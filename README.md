### Installation

Docker-compose file is expected to provide all the necessary installation steps.

Composer will install and migrate the database at the installation stage.

### Login

A default user with username ("test") and weak password ("azerty") will be set. This user has the administrator role 
granted.

The login can be performed by the /api/login route, available in the "default" part of the documentation.
